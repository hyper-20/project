      <h2>Hidirellez(Traditational festival)</h2>
      <div>
        The Hıdırellez, which falls on May 5-6, is a celebration of “the day of Hızır” -- which is the day that the prophets Hızır and İlyas met in Islamic belief. It is believed that all wishes that are made on that night will be granted within the span of a year.Hıdrellez celebrations are always performed in green, wooded places, near sources of water, or near a tomb or shrine. Eating fresh spring plants, lamb's meat or lamb's liver is another custom in Hıdrellez. It is believed that eating the first lamb of spring will bring health and cure the sick.On the night of Hıdırellez, people gather around a bonfire, jumping over the flames wishing for health, happiness, prosperity and even love. Spending the day close to a water body, contemplating its vastness and purity is another important ritual of the day.

      <h2>Mesir Macunu (Traditational festival)</h2>
      <div>
        The Mesir Macunu festival of Manisa, Turkey, commemorates the recovery of Hafsa Sultan, mother of Suleiman the Magnificent, who was cured of a disease by the invention of a paste known as mesir macunu. The Sultan then ordered that the paste be disseminated to the public. So, every year from 21 to 24 March, the paste is prepared by a chef and apprentices from 41 fresh spices and herbs according to traditional practice. A team of 14 women wrap the paste in small pieces of paper, and 28 imams and apprentices bless it before scattering the paste from the top of the minaret and the domes of the Sultan Mosque. Thousands of people come from different regions of Turkey to compete to catch the pieces as they fall. Many believe that by so doing their wishes for marriage, work and children will come true within a year. A 45-piece orchestra dressed in traditional clothing perform historical Ottoman music during the preparation of the paste and throughout the festival. Inhabitants of Manisa have a deep emotional attachment to the festival. The strength of tradition creates a strong sense of solidarity among local communities, and the city welcomes guests from almost all regions of Turkey.
