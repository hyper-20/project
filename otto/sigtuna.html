                <p class="mt-4">
                    One for the history maven, Sigtuna is Sweden's first-ever town, replete with the country's oldest pedestrian street and the highest number of runestones globally. Close to Stockholm, it makes for an ideal day trip – but is equally deserving of a longer stay.

                    Hugging the shores of Lake Mälaren, Sigtuna is the old Swedish capital – and it has plenty of culture and history to show for it. Founded in AD 980 by Erik the Victorious, it boasts a remarkably well-preserved main street – 'Stora Gatan' – which still runs along its original route. The town's Viking heritage is everywhere to be seen; Sigtuna is the most runestone-rich destination in the world – and you'll also get to discover several historically significant churches and ruins.

                    Read more about the Vikings in our article on their history.

                    With its varied natural terrain spanning meadows, forests and coastlines, it's also ideal as a summer destination for outdoor enthusiasts, though it is a charming place to visit year-round. Hiking, biking, swimming and boating are all within easy reach, and there are ten nature reserves to discover in the surroundings of this gem of a town, located less than 40 minutes’ drive from Stockholm.

                    Lap up the rich history and culture of Sigtuna
                </h1>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    A little like an outdoor museum, Sigtuna is studded with relics and monuments, each giving a glimpse into the town's fascinating history and varying architectural styles through the centuries. The town centre's quaint cobblestone streets won't disappoint anyone hoping to find souvenir shops in Sigtuna, though it's more likely you've come here to marvel at its historical riches.

                    As for the must-see landmarks, St Mary's Church is an excellent place to start. Built by the Dominican order as a convent church, this 13th-century edifice is constructed entirely of bricks in a transitional style, landing somewhere between Romanesque and Gothic. Wander a bit further south, and you'll soon find yourself in Stora Torget square, peering at its crowning 18th-century glory – the most diminutive town hall in Sweden, possibly even in Europe.
                    
                    To get an overarching grasp of Sigtuna's long history, don't miss the centrally located Sigtuna Museum and its compelling exhibitions and displays. Here, you can also access a map – full of intriguing information – leading you to Sigtuna's many rune stones, most of which date back to the second half of the 11th century.
                    
                    A hop and a skip from the town centre, you'll find a trio of medieval church ruins – St. Peter's, St. Lawrence's and St. Olof's, each with a fascinating story to tell. There are also five castles waiting to be discovered. The baroque 17th-century Skokloster Castle is a sight to behold in its elevated lakeside position. Rosersberg Palace, one of Sweden's ten royal palaces, is equally enchanting, and so too the medieval gem Wenngarn Castle. Add to that the fairytale-like Skånelaholm Castle and the 18th-century Steninge Castle, and you could easily plan a palace -hopping day trip filled with regal history and nature in the form of elegantly landscaped castle grounds.
                    
                    Something of a cultural oasis, The Sigtuna Foundation has attracted famous writers, academics and creatives since it was founded in 1917. Its rich events programme covers anything from art exhibitions and concerts to author gatherings. You can even eat and sleep in this welcoming environment inspired by Italian monasteries.
