                <p>Reykjavik is the capital city of Iceland located on the southwestern tip of the island. It’s the natural starting point for most international visitors who fly into Keflavík International Airport, a short 40-minute drive away. Domestic connections mostly fly from Reykjavik Airport near the city center. </p>

                <p>Reykjavik is a lively city known for its vibrant culture and nightlife all year round, and home to some impressive architecture–Perlan, Hallgrimskirkja Church and Harpa Concert Hall are some iconic Icelandic buildings to check out. Annual festivals like the Reykjavik Arts Festival, Reykjavik Pride and Iceland Airwaves music festival draw regular crowds.</p>
                <p>Nearby attractions include the famous Blue Lagoon in Grindavik, Grotta with views of Snaefellsjökull glacier on clear days and the Northern Lights in winter. You can take a boat to Viðey Island to see the Imagine Peace Tower, a memorial by Yoko Ono for John Lennon.</p>
                <p>Reykjavik is quite small and most of its sights are within walking distance of the city center. A good place to stay would be in Miðborg or Reykjavik 101 in the heart of the city. Check out the top-rated Reykjavik Residence Hotel or Guesthouse Sunna for a more budget-friendly option.</p>
                <h3><b>2. Ísafjörður</b></h3>

                <figcaption> Image: Ísafjörður Tour guide</figcaption>
                <p>The largest city in Iceland’s Westfjords, Ísafjörður is the main hub for visitors to explore this relatively remote peninsula off the northwestern coast of Iceland. A domestic flight from Reykjavik takes just 40 minutes compared to an almost 6-hour drive through the fjords.</p>

                <p>With a population of under 3,000 people, Ísafjörður is a quiet town filled with 19th-century wooden houses. The Maritime Museum in the downtown area shares the history of Iceland’s fishing industry. You can take a boat out to Vigur Island for some birdwatching and see Iceland’s smallest post office and only windmill.</p>
                
                <h4><b>3. Akureyri</b></h4>
                <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/cf/7b/c1/caption.jpg?w=1600&h=-1&s=1"

                <p>Akureyri is known as Iceland’s “capital of the north” and is located at the base of Eyjafjörður, one of Iceland’s longest fjords. Akureyri is a key trading port and cultural center and has the only airport in the north that receives international flights. The fastest way to get to Akureyri from Reykjavik is by a 45-minute domestic flight; the journey by car takes around 6 hours via the Ring Road.</p>

                <p>Major sights within the city include the imposing Akureyrarkirkja Lutheran Church, the outdoor geothermal swimming pool right beside it, and the world’s northernmost botanical garden and golf course. Culture lovers will enjoy the many unusual museums in Akureyri like the Motorcycle Museum and Aviation Museum. Akureyri is one of the best cities in Iceland to catch the Northern Lights during the winter months.</p>

                <figcaption> Image: Húsavík city </figcaption>
                <p>Húsavík is the oldest settlement in Iceland, dating back to 864, where legend says a viking blown off course built the first house here. Today, Húsavík is recognized for two wildly different things: the whale watching capital of Iceland, and the main setting of the 2020 Netflix movie Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.</p>
                <p>Húsavík is located on the coast of Skjálfandi bay, a hotspot for whales and dolphins–humpback whales, pilot whales, white beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises are commonly spotted here, especially during summer. Lundey Island, located within the bay, is an uninhabited island and breeding ground for puffins–take a tour to spot both whales and puffins.</p>

                <p>Húsavík is the main town located on Iceland’s Diamond Circle that covers some of northeastern Iceland’s most magnificent natural landmarks: the beautiful Lake Mývatn area is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna and volcanic landscapes; Dettifoss Waterfall is the largest waterfall in Iceland and the most powerful in Europe; while Ásbyrgi Canyon, a picturesque horseshoe shaped canyon in Vatnajökull National Park, is popular with hikers.</p>

                <h6><b>5. Seyðisfjörður</b></h6>
                <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/da/12/a1/caption.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1"

                <figcaption> Image: Seyðisfjörður city </figcaption>
                <p>Seyðisfjörður is a charming town hidden in the remote Eastern Fjords of Iceland, an 8-hour drive from Reykjavik and located off the Ring Road from Egilsstaðir. With its roots as a fishing village, it has a large port and is the only place in Iceland where the Norræna car ferry connects with the Faroe Islands and Norway.</p>

                <p>Despite its relatively secluded location, Seyðisfjörður has developed into one of Iceland’s main creative hubs. The Skaftfell Center for Visual Art regularly hosts art events and has an arts residency for local and international artists; many visitors come here for the annual LungA youth arts festival in July. Seydisfjordur Church with its rainbow-colored path (Regnbogastræti or Rainbow Street) leading up to it is one of the more popular attractions in the town.</p>
