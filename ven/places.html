           <h1>Vatnajökull</h1>
            <p>Home to one of the largest glaciers in the world, Vatnajökull National Park is one of our favorite places to explore ice caves. But there's more than just frozen ice rivers to see at Vatnajökull, which covers much of Iceland's eastern half. It holds two of the island's most active volcanoes, herds of reindeer around Mt. Snæfell, and a number of breathtaking waterfalls, including Svartifoss, Dettifoss, and Selfoss.</p>

                    <h2>Westfjords</h2>
                <p>Only about 14 percent of visitors to Iceland ever get to this large peninsula in the northwestern part of the country, which makes it a fitting destination for those looking to escape the (relative) hustle and bustle of Reykjavik. Home to some of Iceland's most dramatic landscapes, diverse wildlife, and charming beach towns (like Breiðavík, pictured), the Westfjords are more inaccessible than other parts of the country, but are well worth the trip.</p>

                <p>Just a 20-minute drive from Vik, in southern Iceland, jet-black sand and spectacularly shaped basalt columns make Reynisfjara one of the most impressive sites in the country. Spend a foggy afternoon strolling along the rugged coast (just strolling—these waters are definitely not made for swimming) and photographing the moon-like rock formations, deep caves, and towering cliff faces.</p>

                <p>Located in Iceland's southern Highlands, the area of Landmannalaugar has some of the most colorful landscapes in the country thanks to its high geothermal activity. It's an extremely popular hiking area during the summer months, where lucky visitors can be surrounded by a veritable kaleidoscope of greens, oranges, reds, blacks, browns, and more.Although the altitude is over 600 metres, the climate is surprisingly mild and the river banks are covered in grass and flowers.</p>

                <p>Víti is a geothermal crater lake found in Askja Caldera in the Icelandic Central Highlands.Scientists have confirmed Víti naturally formed at the bottom of one of Askja's craters. But its name, meaning "hell," owes to lore that Iceland's large craters were gates to the underworld. And it's not just eye candy: Weather permitting, visitors can swim in the warm, mineral-rich lake.Víti is a very nice volcanic lake. It's very easily accessible by car (the parking lot is right next to it). </p>

The spot earns even more visual bonus points when it's reflecting the Northern Lights. </p>
