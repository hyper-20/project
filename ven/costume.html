                <h1>20th-century Upphlutur</h1>
                <p>The upphlutur underwent transformations in response to evolving fashion trends, ideas, and the availability of materials. By the 20th century, the upphlutur had taken on a distinct identity from its predecessor. The skirt, now sewn from black silk satin or similar fabric, harmonized with a bodice made from the same material, invariably in black. The neckline of the bodice was lower, and the number of eyelets was reduced to four sets. </p>

                <p>The velvet ribbons on the front of the bodice became wider, embellished with metal-thread embroidery or silver flowers. The narrow trim on the shoulder seams and two trim lengths in the middle of the back remained distinguishing features. </p>
                <p>The chemise occasionally featured a lower neckline, and the color palette expanded to include various shades. Fabrics for the chemise and apron became more diverse, with synthetic materials gaining popularity in the mid-20th century. The cap transformed into a shallower design, sewn from velvet and adorned with a long black silk tassel. </p>
                <p>A silver brooch adorned the neck, and silver cufflinks became a stylish addition. Belts made of metal links or velvet with silver ornamentation completed the ensemble. Present-day upphlutur costumes are generally sewn from woolen cloth and paired with a light-colored shirt. The apron boasts vertical stripes or checks, while the cap is knitted from fine black woolen yarn but with a shallower profile. Women traditionally wear black stockings and shoes to complete the upphlutur attire.</p>

                <h2>Men’s National Costume</h2>
                <p>Men’s attire during the 18th and 19th centuries commonly featured garments crafted from homespun woolen cloth in shades of dark blue, black, or brown. An undershirt was tucked into knee-length breeches with a fall-front or codpiece fastened to the waistband with buttons. The cuffs of the breeches were also buttoned. Braces, typically tablet-woven, were crossed at the front and back to hold up the breeches. </p>

                <p>Waistcoats, originally knitted and later sewn from dark or colored woolen fabric, had a high neckline and extended below the waist. They were double-breasted and could be buttoned in either direction. The neckline, armholes, and plackets were adorned with woolen facings. A simpler version of the waistcoat, known as a brjóstadúkur, had buttons on the left side and shoulder, with an external pocket.</p>
                <p>The collarless jacket boasted curved sleeves and buttoned cuffs. Its wide, double-breasted front could be buttoned in various ways, employing tin, pewter, bone, or silver buttons. Men also wore a neckerchief and a striped knitted woolen cap, complete with a short tassel. Their long knitted woolen socks were held up by garters positioned below the knee. Simple, homemade shoes made from sheep leather or fish skin completed their footwear.</p>
